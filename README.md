# NFT Real Estate Escrow Contract

Real Estate contract mints an NFT title to a real condo in NYC worth 90 ETH, 
Escrow contract model helps facilitate the deal between the buyer, seller, the lender (bank? lol) and an inspector(to appraise the property) -we are absolutely under the assumption that the property passes inspection onetime without any faults ;)...
Brownie implementation and tests.
