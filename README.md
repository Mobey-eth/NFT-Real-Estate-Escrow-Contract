# NFT Real Estate Escrow Contract

 - Real Estate contract mints an NFT title to a real condo in NYC worth 90 ETH.
 - Escrow contract model helps facilitate the deal between the buyer, seller, the lender (bank? lol) and an inspector(to appraise the property) -we are absolutely under    the assumption that the property passes inspection onetime without any faults ;)...
 - Brownie implementation and tests.
